# BuildItBigger

Project was implemented for Android Developer Nanodegree Program from Udacity, for educational purpose only. The project consists of four modules: 

* A Java library that provides jokes
* A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
* An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
* An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module using an AsyncTask and passes them to the Android Library for display.The app has a paid and a free version, implemented using flavors. In the free version, there is a BannerAd and an IntersitialAd displayed.
